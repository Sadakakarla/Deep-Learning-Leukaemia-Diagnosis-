**Title:**
Leukaemia Detection and Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Abstract:**
White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, or
WBCs, spread abnormally in the bone marrow and blood, resulting in leukaemia (blood cancer). Leukaemia can be identified
by pathologists by examining a patient’s blood sample under
a microscope. By counting different blood cells and physical
characteristics, they can identify and classify leukaemia. This
method takes a lot of time to forecast leukaemia. The pathologist’s
professional qualifications and experiences may also have an
impact on this process. Traditional machine learning and deep
learning techniques in computer vision are useful road maps that
improve the precision and speed of identifying and categorizing
medical images, such as minuscule blood cells. This paper offers
a thorough analysis of the different Deep CNN models for
identification and classification of WBCs and acute leukaemia
in microscopic blood cells.

**Description:**
This project investigates the application of Deep CNNs for automated identification and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) and acute leukemia in microscopic blood images.
The goal is to improve the accuracy and speed of leukemia diagnosis compared to traditional microscopy methods.

**Problem:**
Traditional microscopy-based leukemia diagnosis is time-consuming and relies on pathologist expertise, which can introduce subjectivity.

**Proposed Solution:**
This project explores deep learning, specifically Deep CNNs, as a potential tool for faster and more objective leukemia detection and classification.
The paper compares the performance of different Deep CNN models in identifying and classifying WBCs and leukemia in blood smears.
